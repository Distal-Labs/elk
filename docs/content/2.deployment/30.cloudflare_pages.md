# Cloudflare Pages
> üëãüèº **Before you continue:** please read through the [Getting Started](10.getting_started.md) page as it contains important information that can help you avoid common gotchas. It also has instructions to help you fork the Elk repository and to configure a Cloudflare KV namespace, which are prerequisites to the section below.
--------------
## Introduction
This section covers the basics of deploying Elk to Cloudflare Pages. Many of the steps in this guide can be completed using the Cloudflare Dashboard or Cloudflare's command-line interface, [`wrangler`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/), but some of the steps can <u>only</u> be completed using Wrangler while others can only be completed using the Dashboard. In order to minimize confusion, this guide focuses on the `wrangler` (CLI) approach as much as possible.

If you prefer to use the Cloudflare Dashboard, please refer to [Cloudflare's official documentation](https://pages.cloudflare.com) to set up your Pages project and for guidance on using [Direct Upload](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/platform/direct-upload/) to publish your site.


## Initial (one-time) setup
<details>
<summary>Create a Cloudflare Pages Project</summary>
<br>

You'll need to create a Cloudflare Pages project before you can upload your assets. To do this, replace the placeholder values and run the following command:
```sh
wrangler pages project create YOUR_DESIRED_CLOUDFLARE_PROJECT_NAME --production-branch GITHUB_BRANCH_YOU_ARE_USING
```
<details>
<summary><b>üëÄ Known Gotcha</b></summary>

> If you omit the --production-branch flag, Cloudflare Pages designates the first branch that you publish as your <u>Production</u> deployment. If, later on, you publish a different branch using the *same* project name, Cloudflare Pages will designate that as your <u>Preview</u> deployment.
</details>

<BR>

Then, in your browser, navigate to the *account-level* [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com), then click on the "Pages" link in the left-side navigation bar. You should see your newly-created Pages project near the top of the list:
<BR><BR>
![Screenshot of the Pages section of the Cloudflare Dashboard](/docs/images/selfhosting-guide/cf-pages-project.png)
<BR><BR>
Click on the name of your Pages project, then navigate to Settings > Environment variables > Add variables:
<BR><BR>
![Screenshot of the Pages section of the Cloudflare Dashboard](/docs/images/selfhosting-guide/cf-pages-settings-1.png)
<BR><BR>
Add the following environment variables to your Production environment:

| Variable name | value |
| :- | -: |
`HOST` | `0.0.0.0`
`NODE_ENV` | `production`
`NUXT_DEPLOY_URL` | `https://REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_ELK_DOMAIN`
`NUXT_PUBLIC_DEFAULT_SERVER` | `REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_MASTODON_DOMAIN`
`NUXT_STORAGE_DRIVER` | `kv-binding`
`PORT` | `443`

Once you've added all the values, click save, then click the "Functions" link:
<BR><BR>
![Screenshot of the Pages section of the Cloudflare Dashboard](/docs/images/selfhosting-guide/cf-pages-settings-2.png)

Scroll down the page until you reach the section labeled **KV namespace bindings**. Enter `STORAGE` (in all-caps) in the box labeled **Variable name**, then select the namespace that you [created earlier](10.getting_started.md) from the drop-down menu. Lastly, click **Save**:

<details>
<summary>Install (or Update) Cloudflare Wrangler</summary>
<br>

If you haven't done so already, install Cloudflare's command-line interface, Wrangler, by running:
```sh 
npm -g add wrangler
```

<br>

If you already have `wrangler` installed, verify that you're running wrangler 2.10+ by calling `wrangler version`. To update, run:

```sh
npm -g update wrangler
```

<details>
<summary><b>üëÄ Known Gotcha</b></summary>

> Installing wrangler to the local (Elk project) directory is strongly discouraged as doing so may inadvertently trigger a cascade of errors stemming from incompatible dependencies while simultaneously throwing the `pnpm-lock.yaml` and `package.json` files out of sync. This will, in turn, cause Elk build-time errors.
> 
> If you don't want to install `wrangler` globally (or lack the permissions to do so), then we recommend using the `npx` command instead of installing `wrangler` to the project directory. To do this, simply prepend `npx` to any command in this guide that begins with `wrangler`. For example, `wrangler pages dev` would become `npx wrangler pages dev`. Note: this approach still requires that you have npm installed.
>
> If you run into problems during Wrangler installation, please refer to [Cloudflare's Wrangler documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/) for detailed instructions and troubleshooting steps

## Build and publish

> üëÄ There's a bash script at the [end of this guide](#resources) that combines the following steps

Open a terminal window, and change the working directory to the folder containing the forked repository:
```sh
cd REPLACE_WITH_THE_PATH_TO_THE_LOCAL_CLONE_OF_THE_ELK_REPO
```

Install project dependencies by running the following command:
```sh
npx pnpm --filter=\!./docs i
``` 

Build the app by replacing the placeholder values and running the following command:
```sh
NODE_ENV=production \
  HOST=0.0.0.0 \
  NUXT_PUBLIC_DEFAULT_SERVER=REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_MASTODON_DOMAIN \
  NUXT_DEPLOY_URL=https://REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_ELK_DOMAIN \
  NUXT_STORAGE_DRIVER=kv-binding \
  VITE_DEV_PWA=true \
  NITRO_PRESET=cloudflare npx nuxi build
```

<details>
<summary><b>üëÄ Known Gotcha</b></summary>

> If you're familiar with the Nitro build/prerendering system, you may have noticed that we're using the `cloudflare` preset instead of the `cloudflare_pages` presetÔºç that's not a typo. In our testing, the `cloudflare_pages` preset generated an incomplete routing tree that throws errors and sends billable usage through the roof. The underlying cause of the problem is well-known, well-documented, and well-beyond the scope of the Elk project. If you're curious, see: [cloudflare/workers-sdk #1859](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/issues/1859), [unjs/nitro #196](https://github.com/unjs/nitro/issues/196), and [unjs/nitro #497](https://github.com/unjs/nitro/issues/497). If you follow this guide, your deployment will use the source code in the `/functions` directory, which was written specifically to workaround these issues.
</details>

Upon the completion of a successful build, you will find two (2) additional folders in your project directory: `.nuxt` and `.output`. For the purposes of Cloudflare Pages, we only care about the `.output/public` folder.

Publish your site to Cloudflare Pages by running the following command

```sh
wrangler pages publish .output/public --project-name=YOUR_CLOUDFLARE_PROJECT_NAME --branch=GITHUB_BRANCH_YOU_ARE_USING
```

## That's it! ü•≥ 
You should be able to see your Elk deployment by visiting the link provided by `wrangler` upon completion

## CI/CD using Github Actions
<details>
<summary><b>üëÄ Known Gotcha</b></summary>

> You have to set up your Cloudflare Pages project [as described above](#initial-one-time-setup) before you can use the Github Actions workflow.
</details>

A Github Actions workflow definition file that can be used to automate deployments to Cloudflare Pages is included in the Elk project repository (see `./.github/workflows/cloudflare_pages.yml`). The included workflow is configured to use a manual trigger by default, and includes examples that can be used to automatically trigger deployments every time a new release becomes available or whenever there's a push to the `release` branch. To use this workflow, you'll first need to:

1. Add your [Cloudflare account ID](10.getting_started.md) to your fork of the Elk repository <u>**as a secret**</u> with the name/label `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`
2. Add your Cloudflare Pages project name to your fork of the Elk repository <u>**as a secret**</u> with the name/label `CLOUDFLARE_PAGES_PROJECT_NAME`
3. Create a Cloudflare API token with `Cloudflare Pages:Edit` permissions, then add the token to your fork of the Elk repository <u>**as a secret**</u> with the name/label `CLOUDFLARE_PAGES_API_TOKEN`
4. Add the following to your fork of the Elk repository <u>**as environment variables**</u>:
    - `NUXT_DEPLOY_URL`
    - `NUXT_PUBLIC_DEFAULT_SERVER`

<details>
<summary><b>üëÄ Known Gotcha</b></summary>

> You do *NOT* need to specify `GITHUB_TOKEN` as this value is passed to your Github Actions build runner automatically by Github.
</details>

## FAQ
<details>
  <summary>Is it possible to set up a CI/CD pipeline using something other than Github Actions?</summary>
  
  > Yes, it is possible to set up a CI/CD pipeline using CircleCI or Travis CI by following the [instructions published by Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/how-to/use-direct-upload-with-continuous-integration/). If you've implemented a CI/CD pipeline for Elk using another platform, we'd welcome your contributions to this guide.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Are you intentionally avoiding the Cloudflare Pages GitHub integration?</summary>

> **Short answer:** Yes.
>
> **Long answer:** Yes, because Cloudflare Pages uses outdated build images that [lack support for Node.js >= v17.x](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/platform/build-configuration/). After spending several hours on Cloudflare Community and Cloudflare Discord, it's clear that there are no workarounds. Cloudflare representatives on Discord point to a forthcoming update to their build image library, but offer no specific date of release. Cloudflare Pages build images also lack built-in support for `pnpm`, but there is a [known workaround](https://community.cloudflare.com/t/add-pnpm-to-pre-installed-cloudflare-pages-tools/288514/3). Even after Cloudflare (eventually) updates its build images, there's no guarantee that they'll ship with `pnpm` as an option.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Will this guide also work for deployment to Cloudflare Workers as a Workers Site?</summary>

> **Short answer:** No.
>
> **Long answer:** No, because Cloudflare Workers is a serverless platform built using Web APIs that offers *very limited* and *extremely outdated* compatibility for Node.js.
>
> **Longer answer:** No, for all the reasons stated above plus, after successfully shoe-horning a deployment to Cloudflare Workers Sites we discovered that we ended up with a costlier version of what we've laid out in this guide. We were able to realize cost savings using Cloudflare Pages by separating routes serving static assets (no charge) from dynamic routes (each invocation counts against the _Free Tier_ allowance).
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Why did you write your own Cloudflare Pages Functions?</summary>

> The build system (Nitro) is unable to generate a complete, Pages-compatible `/functions` routing treeÔºç even when invoking the `NITRO_PRESET=cloudflare_pages` flag at build time. Instead, Nitro generates a single catch-all function that is only able to handle `GET` requests, and returns HTTP 405 errors for `POST` requests. Not only does this routing behavior make Elk unusable, it also results in billable events for static assets (`GET` requests for static assets would otherwise be free under Cloudflare's current billing scheme). 
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Are there gotchas to customizing the /functions directory?</summary>

> Manually writing Cloudflare Pages Functions was the only way to make this deployment option available. It was a time-consuming process because the debugging toolkit available for Cloudflare Functions is limited to a handler invocation logstream. For these same reasons, it is highly unlikely that the Elk project will be able to help troubleshoot issues arising from customizations to the provided CF Pages Functions. As such, we strongly recommend against making changes to the `/functions` folder unless you are very familiar with the Cloudflare Functions product, the Cloudflare Workers platform, and Web API standards.
